1. output_csv_forkml.m: to generate a csv (for further transfrom to KML) within a given domain
   (need modify lon_limit, lat_limit, out_dom_name)

2. output_lonlatdom_chanidx_chanlonlat.m, to generate a txt file for channel node lon/lat, to plot channel node markers   
   (need modify lon_limit, lat_limit, out_dom_name)

3. output_inpolygon_chanidx_chanlonlat.m, to generate a txt for channel node lon/lat, to plot channel node markers
   different with 2.: can give a polygon, by which the channel node should be limited in
   (need modify lon_limit, lat_limit, out_dom_name, file_polygon_lonlat)
   the polygon file is formatted as BAB/reformated_BAB_channel_boundary.txt, which can be generated by:
   a. draw a polygon on Google Earth (based on nodes KML file, generated by 1. output_csv_forkml.m)
   b. save the polygon as another KML file (i.e. polygon.kml)
   c. open polygon.kml with vim or other editor
   d. find a line with multiple lon,lat
   e. reformat the lon,lat line to the format as BAB/reformated_BAB_channel_boundary.txt, refer to BAB/reformat_channel_boundary.sh to do the reformating
